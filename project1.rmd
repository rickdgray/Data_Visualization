**This project is due on the deadline posted on edX. Please submit as a pdf file.**


**Part 1:** Demonstrate basic command of Markdown by creating a bulleted list with three items, a numbered list with three items, and a sentence that has one word in bold and one word in italics.

*Your text goes here.*

**Part 2:** The `mtcars` dataset contains information on car design and performance in 1974:

```{r}
mtcars
```

Use ggplot to make a line plot of the weight of a car (column `wt`) versus its fuel economy, measured in miles/gallon (column `mpg`).

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

Now make a scatter plot (using `geom_point()`) of the weight of the car versus its horse power (`hp`), and color points by its fuel economy.

```{r}
# your code goes here
```
